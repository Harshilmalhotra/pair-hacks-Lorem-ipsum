# PDF Data Masking Application
## Project Overview
The PDF Data Masking application is designed to ensure data privacy and security by masking sensitive information in input PDF files. This application can handle both text and images within the PDF, accommodating diverse names across different demographics, including Malaysian, Chinese, and Korean names. Leveraging machine learning algorithms, the application accurately identifies and redacts sensitive information, providing comprehensive protection of personal data.

## Features
Text and Image Handling: Masks sensitive information in both text and images within the PDF.
Demographic Diversity: Supports the identification of names from various demographics, including Malaysian, Chinese, and Korean.
Machine Learning Integration: Utilizes machine learning algorithms to accurately identify and redact sensitive information.
Data Privacy and Security: Ensures comprehensive protection of personal data by effectively masking sensitive information.
